# 2DLuaRenderEngine
A pure lua render engine.

Not really meant to be serious, just a fun project I took up.

To run the program you need to install the lua binaries [http://luabinaries.sourceforge.net/download.html] and then run run.lua (or you could just run init.lua if you are crazy)

Requires ffmpeg [https://ffmpeg.org/download.html], once you download the zip, unpack it into a bin folder in the project files.

Has 2 example files

render.lua0 contains code for creating 2d metaballs with the Metaball class

render.lua1 contains code for creating a binary image out of a string.
